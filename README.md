MisinforAI is a web-based application designed to help users quickly assess the credibility and reliability of online news articles. By submitting a news article URL, the application analyzes the content using a pre-trained
machine learning model to generate a structured, objective rubric (or scorecard). This tool breaks down the article's characteristics into various categories, providing a final, data-driven score to highlight potential 
misinformation indicators.

Key Features
URL-Based Analysis: Accepts any news article URL and extracts the core content for analysis.
ML-Powered Scoring: Utilizes an integrated machine learning model to calculate a credibility score.
Structured Rubric: Presents the results in a clear, categorized format, detailing scores for various aspects.
Interactive Web Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for input and viewing results.
